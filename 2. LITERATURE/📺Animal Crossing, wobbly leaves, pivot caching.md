# Ideas

Insert into the object vertext color of leafs the coord of the origin point of the leafs 

Into your shaders, do the following to update position / Rotation of the leaf:
1. Take vertex coord 
2. Remove the origin point taken into vertex color
3. apply transform to the item
4. add back the origin point
