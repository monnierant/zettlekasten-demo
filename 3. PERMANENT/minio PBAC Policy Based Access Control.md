## Read only bucket permission

For `secured-demo` bucket
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
         "Effect" : "Allow",
         "Action" : [ "s3:GetBucketLocation", "s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket" ],
         "Resource" : "arn:aws:s3:::secured-demo"
      }
    ]
}
```

> [!hint] 
> Create the `policy` then add it to the `group` and add `user` to the `group`
