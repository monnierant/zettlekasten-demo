# Idea


How can we automaticaly build a simple docker container for helping purpose ?

It must get the following features:
- [ ] Use gitlab CI/CD
- [ ] Use git flow feature / Relsease process
- [ ] Publish on gitlab CI/CD repository
- [ ] No manual interaction except git flow commands or merging request in gitlab
